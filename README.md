# Personal Account App 

## Project Pitch

Website that displays a list of user cards on the main page and clicks on each card to open a page with detailed information about the user.

## Product Features

- The user list is only available to registered users;
- The user page displays the data of a specific user;
- The token stors in the browser's memory and deletes after clicking on the "exit" button.

## How to start the App:

add https://reqres.in/api/ into .env.local 

To sign in or sign up use default Users emails from https://reqres.in/

`npm install`;

`npm start` to run the server

The server will start and the app will be opened in a new tab in your browser.
You can stop the server by simply closing the terminal in which you started it.
