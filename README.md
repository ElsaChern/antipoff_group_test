# Personal Account App 

## Project Pitch

Website that displays a list of user cards on the main page and clicks on each card to open a page with detailed information about the user.

## Product Features

- The user list is only available to registered users;
- The user page displays the data of a specific user;
- The token stors in the browser's memory and deletes after clicking on the "exit" button.

## How to start the App:

Add `https://reqres.in/api/` into .env.local (You should create `env.local` file and put `REACT_APP_API_URI = https://reqres.in/api/` there)

To sign in or sign up use default Users emails from https://reqres.in/; (example: eve.holt@reqres.in, george.bluth@reqres.in)

`npm install` - to install dependencies;

`npm start` to run the server

The server will start and the app will be opened in a new tab in your browser.
You can stop the server by simply closing the terminal in which you started it.
